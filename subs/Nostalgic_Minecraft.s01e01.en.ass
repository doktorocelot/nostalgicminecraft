Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.13,0:00:01.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Hello.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.39,0:00:04.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Welcome to Minecraft, but with a bit of a twist.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.23,0:00:09.48,Default,,0,0,0,,So if you look in the top left, there is a version number.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.48,0:00:13.76,Default,,0,0,0,,1.19.4, the latest version available at the time of recording this.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.21,0:00:17.53,Default,,0,0,0,,However, the title screen looks a little different, doesn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.26,0:00:23.48,Default,,0,0,0,,This will be a playthrough of Minecraft, but I have a mod installed
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.48,0:00:27.01,Default,,0,0,0,,that makes the game act a lot like it did, almost....
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.01,0:00:34.25,Default,,0,0,0,,I want to say 12, 13 years ago, but it will still have a lot of the modern features.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.25,0:00:36.09,Default,,0,0,0,,That mod is called {\i1}Nostalgic Tweaks{\i0}.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.11,0:00:37.91,Default,,0,0,0,,It's the star of the show today.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.91,0:00:43.73,Default,,0,0,0,,In terms of the star of the visual design, we have a resource pack called {\i1}Golden Days {\i0}installed,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.23,0:00:48.23,Default,,0,0,0,,which brings the game back to its roots in terms of the visual design
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.23,0:00:54.38,Default,,0,0,0,,and also takes the new stuff and tries to put it in a way that fits with the old stuff as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.38,0:00:56.89,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay, so now we're going to make a new world.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.89,0:01:00.26,Default,,0,0,0,,And, for this, we're going be doing hard, okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.36,0:01:08.44,Default,,0,0,0,,Now we have "Modern Beta" as our generator, which is another mod that allows us to have a beta world.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.08,0:01:11.29,Default,,0,0,0,,Or kind of looks like a beta world,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.29,0:01:14.83,Default,,0,0,0,,but it has a lot of the modern features integrated into the beta world.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.49,0:01:18.58,Default,,0,0,0,,And well, we just may as well hop right in and see what happens.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.06,0:01:23.17,Default,,0,0,0,,I got a couple other mods installed, mainly to improve the performance of the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.17,0:01:25.84,Default,,0,0,0,,There's this one which is making the chunks load quicker.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.84,0:01:30.28,Default,,0,0,0,,So you know, when the game opens the chunks will be shown instantly when this is done.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.18,0:01:34.18,Default,,0,0,0,,Anyways, we're going to hop straight into it. Now,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.03,0:01:38.36,Default,,0,0,0,,We can kind of see what we got. So we spawned in a desert.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.89,0:01:41.98,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay, now, back then you always spawned on sand.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.56,0:01:45.68,Default,,0,0,0,,So there is an example of actually the modern features showing up.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.01,0:01:47.29,Default,,0,0,0,,Alright, that wasn't around.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.61,0:01:54.61,Default,,0,0,0,,But if you look visually at the game, it's definitely not quite as it looks today, is it?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.61,0:01:57.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Lighting-wise, I turned the smooth lighting off because I felt
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.46,0:02:00.46,Default,,0,0,0,,that would create a little more of a classic experience.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.09,0:02:05.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, in terms of what we're going\Nto be doing, this is not a speedrun.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.71,0:02:11.53,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm not going to be rushing for diamonds and rushing to kill the Ender Dragon and this, that and the other.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.89,0:02:16.84,Default,,0,0,0,,In terms of what this video is, it's not intended to make money. Alright?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.86,0:02:19.43,Default,,0,0,0,,Which means, I will not be screaming at you.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.43,0:02:23.56,Default,,0,0,0,,I will not have a pointless facecam in the middle of the screen.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.08,0:02:31.28,Default,,0,0,0,,I will not have other things that are very distracting and don't actually show...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.69,0:02:33.69,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm going to need a little more wood than that.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.69,0:02:44.00,Default,,0,0,0,,...and don't actually show, like, just things that are not, like, necessary, basically.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.00,0:02:48.46,Default,,0,0,0,,If you ever watch a video, like, modern day, you'll often find that
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.73,0:02:52.99,Default,,0,0,0,,very annoyingly, there's lots of annoying effects on the screen.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.99,0:02:54.28,Default,,0,0,0,,They're screaming at you.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.28,0:03:00.17,Default,,0,0,0,,There's tons and tons of stuff, and we're not going to be doing that. Okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.78,0:03:06.86,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm just going to play the game, and I'm going to share my experience playing the game with anyone who's watching.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.76,0:03:15.04,Default,,0,0,0,,That being said, this will not be completely unedited, which means I will be cutting out things that are boring.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.91,0:03:16.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.89,0:03:19.88,Default,,0,0,0,,We going to also take a quick look around, see what we got.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.88,0:03:24.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, over here appears to be a cave.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.26,0:03:26.81,Default,,0,0,0,,Like, with that new stuff, you can see the clay.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.81,0:03:30.76,Default,,0,0,0,,And if you look really closely, you can see, like,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.76,0:03:35.71,Default,,0,0,0,,I forget what it's called there. I haven't really played much of the new stuff, actually, for a while.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.71,0:03:38.93,Default,,0,0,0,,I kind of fell out of interest with this game for quite a while.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.98,0:03:43.35,Default,,0,0,0,,I'd only really play a bunch of complicated modpacks that,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.35,0:03:47.23,Default,,0,0,0,,really, at the end of the day, are just grinding the game but in a different way.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.34,0:03:50.56,Default,,0,0,0,,We got some beaches.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.56,0:03:56.03,Default,,0,0,0,,Beaches were removed from the game when 1.8 came out, and they were never fully added back in.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.03,0:03:57.49,Default,,0,0,0,,We have beaches with...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.49,0:04:02.78,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm going to put 50 quotes around them because they kind of don't really have the shape of beaches.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.13,0:04:06.20,Default,,0,0,0,,In terms of the video you're watching,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.20,0:04:09.16,Default,,0,0,0,,While I am playing the old version of the game,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.94,0:04:14.36,Default,,0,0,0,,I am not going to be making the video shit quality.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.83,0:04:16.78,Default,,0,0,0,,The video will be in 4K.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.78,0:04:20.78,Default,,0,0,0,,I am recording it lossless, and I will also include
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.78,0:04:24.58,Default,,0,0,0,,closed captioning for those who have trouble hearing or understanding
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.58,0:04:28.18,Default,,0,0,0,,English speech as much or just kind of would prefer to have them on the screen.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.18,0:04:31.39,Default,,0,0,0,,So I hope you appreciate that.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.39,0:04:35.23,Default,,0,0,0,,I think accessibility is very important, so I will definitely include those.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.31,0:04:38.96,Default,,0,0,0,,That being said, I'm going to go chop some wood
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.96,0:04:43.33,Default,,0,0,0,,and when the sun starts to set, we'll see what we have to do next.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.38,0:04:47.71,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm also going to grab some coal here, actually, because
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.98,0:04:51.98,Default,,0,0,0,,kind of important, you know, being able to see
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.48,0:04:56.11,Default,,0,0,0,,we have lots of old things and that also includes the old lighting.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.48,0:04:59.48,Default,,0,0,0,,And the old lighting gets very dark.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.48,0:05:02.48,Default,,0,0,0,,If you saw earlier when I was looking into that cave,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.76,0:05:07.51,Default,,0,0,0,,yeah, not quite the brightest thing. Okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.51,0:05:11.41,Default,,0,0,0,,So it's going to be a little bit essential to actually have our light.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.01,0:05:14.53,Default,,0,0,0,,Also, I should mention the animal spawning
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.53,0:05:18.91,Default,,0,0,0,,is going to be like old Minecraft, which means that they will spawn
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.91,0:05:22.99,Default,,0,0,0,,where there is grass and light, including during the nighttime and daytime.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.99,0:05:28.91,Default,,0,0,0,,They spawn kind of like hostile mobs but in reverse: in the light, but also only on grass.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.19,0:05:35.44,Default,,0,0,0,,This means that farms for animals are kind of pointless because,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.44,0:05:39.68,Default,,0,0,0,,A: They'll actually disappear, from what I understand.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.68,0:05:42.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Like, the ones that don't disappear are, like, the named ones,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.58,0:05:45.91,Default,,0,0,0,,and, like, tamed animals.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.91,0:05:49.24,Default,,0,0,0,,But even if you breed them, I'm pretty sure they despawn,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.43,0:05:56.68,Default,,0,0,0,,which kind of makes farming a little bit pointless for the most part.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.68,0:06:02.29,Default,,0,0,0,,That being said, food is, at that point, going to be a lot easier to get.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.29,0:06:06.82,Default,,0,0,0,,But those of you who have been looking may have noticed that there's no hunger bar.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.82,0:06:10.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, those who have played Minecraft in its earlier days
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.24,0:06:13.84,Default,,0,0,0,,knows why this is the case: because it wasn't a thing at that point.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.59,0:06:20.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Instead, the function food served was specifically for healing. And not only for healing,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.74,0:06:24.71,Default,,0,0,0,,but your health did not naturally regenerate like it does today,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.18,0:06:30.58,Default,,0,0,0,,which means that if you take damage, then that damage stays until you heal it again.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.13,0:06:35.53,Default,,0,0,0,,But that also means that if you don't take damage, you don't have to eat either.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.79,0:06:39.19,Default,,0,0,0,,So bearing that in mind, it's kind of a different balance
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.19,0:06:43.33,Default,,0,0,0,,than the hunger system, which is more of an active problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.78,0:06:47.28,Default,,0,0,0,,And you have to keep it at bay and manage it, basically.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.01,0:06:55.21,Default,,0,0,0,,Whereas, back then you didn't really have to manage it, but you can lose your health very fast.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.91,0:06:58.91,Default,,0,0,0,,The upside is that you can heal very quickly, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.14,0:07:04.99,Default,,0,0,0,,But another downside will become apparent when I'm going to kill some of these animals here.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.68,0:07:08.82,Default,,0,0,0,,Actually, there's two of them. The first one...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.97,0:07:15.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay. Drops nothing. The usual.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.00,0:07:18.53,Default,,0,0,0,,You may notice that these drops aren't quite the same. Well,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.93,0:07:25.88,Default,,0,0,0,,if I remember correctly, I think in modern versions there's a guaranteed food drop since animals are a lot more rare.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.61,0:07:31.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Back then, though, the drop had a chance of being zero.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.19,0:07:34.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Now watch.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.28,0:07:38.98,Default,,0,0,0,,If you notice, they don't stack. Food does not really stack back then.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.64,0:07:40.51,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.51,0:07:47.26,Default,,0,0,0,,So that means that while you can heal very fast, you have to actually have the inventory space for the food.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.13,0:07:57.43,Default,,0,0,0,,And, taking up one slot per single food item, you really can't afford to spend that much of your inventory on food.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.73,0:08:01.73,Default,,0,0,0,,If you're listening, you may hear reverb.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.33,0:08:13.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Yep. I decided to install {\i1}Sound Physics{\i0} too, because just kind of for fun, more or less.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.36,0:08:19.63,Default,,0,0,0,,It's not really very old Minecrafty, but it's not as if new Minecraft has sound physics either, really.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.64,0:08:23.21,Default,,0,0,0,,So I figured there'd be no harm in something a little fun like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.66,0:08:26.83,Default,,0,0,0,,But yeah, it's mostly going to be a vanilla experience apart from that.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.31,0:08:31.93,Default,,0,0,0,,Right, so I should also mention the second issue when it comes to food.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.34,0:08:38.81,Default,,0,0,0,,So as you can see, first of all, it might not drop nearly as often,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.71,0:08:45.16,Default,,0,0,0,,but I want you to kind of watch carefully as I kill the next set of animals.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.18,0:09:00.59,Default,,0,0,0,,So you may have been able to figure it out, but from these cows, I'm only getting leather.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.59,0:09:04.31,Default,,0,0,0,,From these chickens, I'm only getting feathers.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.31,0:09:08.08,Default,,0,0,0,,That's because back then {\i1}that{\i0} was the only food-dropping animal we had.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.38,0:09:15.31,Default,,0,0,0,,So bearing that in mind, the main food source is pork chops.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.16,0:09:23.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Technically, beef, chicken, mutton -- they're all still in the game -- but unless they appear, like,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.85,0:09:29.29,Default,,0,0,0,,in some kind of loot table or, like, a chest or something, it's not really going to be obtainable.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.14,0:09:32.41,Default,,0,0,0,,Not that it really matters too much.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.41,0:09:36.29,Default,,0,0,0,,Pork is plenty fine.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.29,0:09:38.48,Default,,0,0,0,,So we've kind of stocked up on a good amount of food,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.48,0:09:41.71,Default,,0,0,0,,and, if you see, we've got a good amount of wood -- the sun is setting.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.71,0:09:44.78,Default,,0,0,0,,So, I want to build a real house.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.44,0:09:48.46,Default,,0,0,0,,But there's kind of not a lot of time for that.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.06,0:09:52.20,Default,,0,0,0,,You can't really sprint away from mobs anymore because
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.20,0:09:56.48,Default,,0,0,0,,I have not been sprinting not because I don't feel like it, but because there is no sprinting.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.19,0:10:05.59,Default,,0,0,0,,So, I'm going to need to seek shelter really quickly now, or I'm in trouble, basically... is the problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.99,0:10:12.86,Default,,0,0,0,,So, we could do what we always did and carve into the side of the mountain.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.96,0:10:17.95,Default,,0,0,0,,I might want to find a better place to do that, actually.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.95,0:10:22.44,Default,,0,0,0,,That being said, I might have to stop being picky and just get inside.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.44,0:10:23.97,Default,,0,0,0,,Alright. We're going to go in here.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:25.43,0:10:26.14,Default,,0,0,0,,It's getting dark.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.14,0:10:30.29,Default,,0,0,0,,I probably should make some way to actually fucking see the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.04,0:10:35.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay. Yeah, I don't really bite my tongue when it comes to cursing so,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.14,0:10:41.86,Default,,0,0,0,,I hope that's not a problem because there's no chance I'm going to be very safe in terms of the words that I use.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.74,0:10:43.73,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:43.73,0:10:50.11,Default,,0,0,0,,Probably should actually seal it with a door before I get creeped up on by everything in the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.20,0:10:51.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Looks very good.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:53.56,0:10:55.16,Default,,0,0,0,,So no bed at the moment.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:55.16,0:10:57.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Beds are there. We can skip the night.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.56,0:11:01.13,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't know if phantoms actually spawn. I'm probably going to guess that they do.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:01.13,0:11:06.34,Default,,0,0,0,,So we have to actually like utilize it or else we just get fucked by the mobs, which is kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:11:07.34,0:11:08.42,Default,,0,0,0,,definitely a thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.46,0:11:15.40,Default,,0,0,0,,And the sound physics can be a little buggy as well, but you know, what are you going to do?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:16.19,0:11:18.24,Default,,0,0,0,,So we've got an actual home now.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.18,0:11:23.14,Default,,0,0,0,,You can kind of light up the outside, but again, it's pretty dangerous out there right now.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:23.14,0:11:28.00,Default,,0,0,0,,You may have noticed, but the difficulty is not on easy or normal. It's on hard.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.24,0:11:33.83,Default,,0,0,0,,So we can get slaughtered very quickly early game.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.83,0:11:36.83,Default,,0,0,0,,The first night's not going to be super interesting.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:37.04,0:11:43.84,Default,,0,0,0,,So I'm probably just going to go mining for the first night
Dialogue: 0,0:11:45.28,0:11:48.19,Default,,0,0,0,,and start trying to cook these at the same time.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:49.09,0:11:51.34,Default,,0,0,0,,I might start a staircase from here.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:55.06,0:11:57.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Ah, you hear that sound?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:57.08,0:11:59.15,Default,,0,0,0,,That's the sound of monsters.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:59.15,0:12:01.25,Default,,0,0,0,,And you can hear... oh, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:02.81,0:12:04.19,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay, this is a problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:05.29,0:12:08.66,Default,,0,0,0,,I have no armor. I have leather, I can make something.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.66,0:12:10.32,Default,,0,0,0,,It won't really get me much.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:10.73,0:12:12.76,Default,,0,0,0,,We'll do a helmet. Sure. Let's do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:13.46,0:12:17.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Again, that's basically nothing if you look at the bar.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.25,0:12:19.61,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm also not really being very efficient with this.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:19.76,0:12:22.76,Default,,0,0,0,,But, you know, what are we going to do?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:23.36,0:12:25.12,Default,,0,0,0,,I guess we'll finish cooking this now.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:26.69,0:12:32.02,Default,,0,0,0,,This is going to be really good to set up with a hopper, you know, because
Dialogue: 0,0:12:32.02,0:12:34.94,Default,,0,0,0,,no stacking means I can't just load them all in, you know what I mean?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.76,0:12:39.76,Default,,0,0,0,,In terms of this cave, I want to explore it,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:40.58,0:12:42.73,Default,,0,0,0,,but it's really fucking dangerous.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:45.44,0:12:48.44,Default,,0,0,0,,So, we can give it a try.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:49.91,0:12:51.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Take a small look at what we've got.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:53.74,0:12:54.23,Default,,0,0,0,,That's not.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:54.23,0:12:56.63,Default,,0,0,0,,That's not a good sound. That's not a good sound.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:56.63,0:12:58.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah. Okay. We've been spotted.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:59.02,0:13:01.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Oh, my god. This is not good.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:04.34,0:13:05.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:05.54,0:13:08.81,Default,,0,0,0,,You can see how I lost a lot of my HP very quickly there.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:11.94,0:13:16.93,Default,,0,0,0,,Right. Well, so the best I have is this little thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:21.00,0:13:24.36,Default,,0,0,0,,pick something that doesn't really follow the rules of gravity for a second...
Dialogue: 0,0:13:35.81,0:13:37.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Probably just abuse the AI a little bit.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:40.26,0:13:42.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Got it. All right.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:44.29,0:13:47.29,Default,,0,0,0,,See, I had it under control the whole time.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:47.29,0:13:51.26,Default,,0,0,0,,I just only mildly panicked because I had no idea what I was going to do when I was getting shot at.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:51.26,0:13:55.80,Default,,0,0,0,,But, as you can see, it all works out in the end.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:56.99,0:13:58.05,Default,,0,0,0,,That being said,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:00.29,0:14:04.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay, not a problem. I can take care of that very easily.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.04,0:14:06.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Really, skeletons are actually your main adversary.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:07.19,0:14:12.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Probably shouldn't be fucking around in the dark right now, but I need to make torches.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:13.21,0:14:20.36,Default,,0,0,0,,So we do have "deal" w... "deal"? Dual wielding. I'm sorry I can't talk sometimes. Okay, another one. Alright.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:21.61,0:14:23.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Oh, my god. I just replaced my sword.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:23.56,0:14:25.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Oh, this is terrible
Dialogue: 0,0:14:27.49,0:14:29.51,Default,,0,0,0,,And... there we go.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:29.51,0:14:31.50,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay. I got too cocky.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:33.61,0:14:36.67,Default,,0,0,0,,I have no idea where I ended up, but I'm gonna have to find my way back.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:36.67,0:14:38.55,Default,,0,0,0,,And this is what always happens.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:38.55,0:14:42.26,Default,,0,0,0,,In the dark, it's really bad to spawn with nothing
Dialogue: 0,0:14:43.39,0:14:46.81,Default,,0,0,0,,because I can't sprint and now I can't defend myself.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:47.64,0:14:54.30,Default,,0,0,0,,But it was kind of my fault for just diving in without really paying too much attention to my surroundings.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:55.32,0:15:01.69,Default,,0,0,0,,And also... kind of replacing the sword slot with something else was also probably not a good idea as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:02.81,0:15:07.01,Default,,0,0,0,,That won't be very fun. Yeah. There we go.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:07.24,0:15:08.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe they won't see through the flowers.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:08.84,0:15:12.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe they're too stupid to have line of sight. Oh, and they also hit a zombie.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:12.00,0:15:13.15,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay, I see that one.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:14.29,0:15:16.36,Default,,0,0,0,,It may have been over here.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:16.36,0:15:19.64,Default,,0,0,0,,It would actually be easier to find in the nighttime because of that.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:19.64,0:15:21.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes. Okay. We found it.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:22.96,0:15:23.84,Default,,0,0,0,,That's not good.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:25.94,0:15:30.02,Default,,0,0,0,,Unlike the old game, we have the new AI with pathfinding, so.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:30.02,0:15:30.78,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:31.81,0:15:32.80,Default,,0,0,0,,We've got to go.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:37.25,0:15:38.45,Default,,0,0,0,,I left no food there.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:40.04,0:15:42.78,Default,,0,0,0,,So my only chance is to just pick up my stuff.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:46.34,0:15:47.78,Default,,0,0,0,,Probably despawned, right?
